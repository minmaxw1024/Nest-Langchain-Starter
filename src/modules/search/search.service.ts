      'Regardless of the outcome of this week’s U.S. presidential election, former President Donald Trump’s pivot from crypto skeptic to crypto cheerleader has left a big mark on the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nHis embrace of the community has helped push the price of bitcoin toward a new all-time high and brought in hundreds of millions of dollars across prediction markets and memecoins.\n\nIn  the battle between Republican candidate Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the decentralized prediction platform Polymarket has generated a total betting volume of [over $3 billion](https://www.theblock.co/post/324357/us-presidential-winner-prediction-market-crosses-3-billion-on-polymarket-a-day-before-the-election) on the  winner alone.\n\n"Trump’s presidency has historically driven stronger bullish sentiment than Harris is likely to,” said  Georgi Koreli, founder and CEO of Hinkal. “ U.S. blockchain and crypto projects face regulatory scrutiny, deterring some from the market. With Harris as a Democrat, investors may be initially cautious, but both candidates’ likely policies on money supply expansion are expected to favor crypto adoption."\n\n##**Trump’s crypto pivot**Trump\'s stance on cryptocurrency changed in May when his campaign started  [accepting ](https://www.theblock.co/post/295810/trump-campaign-to-accept-crypto-donations-including-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu) crypto as a form of donation. This marked the first time a major U.S. presidential nominee embraced cryptocurrency for donations.\n\nIn June, Trump  [met with executives ](https://www.theblock.co/post/299773/bitcoin-miner-stocks-rise-as-trump-calls-mining-last-line-of-defense-against-cbdc) from various bitcoin mining companies,  [suggesting that](https://www.theblock.co/post/305771/trump-wants-us-in-charge-of-crypto-before-china)  bitcoin mining might be the “last line of defense against” a central bank digital currency.\n\nTrump then chose Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) as his running mate in July. The Republican was seen as favorable to the crypto industry and has been critical of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Vance has an estimated net worth of $5 million and  [disclosed he owns ](https://www.theblock.co/post/305451/trumps-vp-pick-j-d-vance-owns-over-100000-in-bitcoin) between $100,001 and $250,000 in bitcoin as of 2022.\n\nIn August, Trump  [announced ](https://www.theblock.co/post/311585/donald-trump-names-cantor-fitzgerald-ceo-howard-lutnick-to-lead-his-potential-transition-team) that Cantor Fitzgerald Howard Lutnick would help lead his transition team if he became president again. The latter has been described as a “big crypto bull,” and Cantor Fitzgerald has been a custodian for Tether since late 2021.\n\nDuring a campaign stop,  [Trump visited PubKey Bar ](https://www.theblock.co/post/317197/donald-trump-makes-his-first-bitcoin-purchase-on-a-burger-at-pubkey-bar-in-new-york-city) in New York City and made what’s believed to be the first bitcoin purchase ever by a U.S. president, has  [promoted ](https://www.theblock.co/post/308565/donald-trump-selling-bitcoin-sneakers-after-keynote-speech-at-bitcoin-2024) Bitcoin-themed sneakers and even  [wished ](https://www.theblock.co/post/324047/former-president-donald-trump-sends-a-birthday-wish-to-bitcoin-and-takes-a-dig-at-vp-kamala-harris) a happy 16th birthday to Bitcoin.\n\nTrump’s most impactful moment with the industry occurred on July 27, when he gave a  [keynote speech at Bitcoin 2024 ](https://www.theblock.co/post/307913/trump-says-hell-fire-sec-chair-gensler-and-create-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-bitcoin-2024) in Nashville—one of the premier conferences of the year. There, he promised to end “Operation Chokepoint 2.0” and other anti-crypto policies, and he also drew huge cheers for promising to replace Gensler if he’s elected.\n\n"It will be the policy of my administration...to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the US government currently holds or acquires into the future," Trump said in his address. "This will serve in effect as the core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile...It\'s been taken away from you."\n\n##**Trump\'s impact on bitcoin, crypto markets**The Republican candidate’s embrace has given way to the so-called “Trump trade” narrative, which essentially says that a Trump win will lead to a rise in the price of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.\n\n"The ‘Trump trade’ narrative and favorable Q4 seasonality create a perfect storm for bitcoin, promising an exciting period ahead despite potential price volatility leading into the election," Bitfinex analysts  [recently told ](https://www.theblock.co/post/323473/trump-trade-and-derivatives-market-optimism-help-bitcoin-gain-ground-ahead-of-us-election-analysts) The Block.\n\nCoinShares  [said ](https://www.theblock.co/post/324306/crypto-funds-record-2024-inflows-election-euphoria-republican-win-coinshares) global crypto funds run by asset managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, among others, registered net inflows of $2.18 billion last week, bringing year-to-date figures to a record $29.2 billion.\n\n“We believe euphoria around the prospect of a Republican victory was the likely reason for these inflows as they were in the first few days of last week,” CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill said in a report one day before the election.\n\nAnalysts at Bernstein  [expect ](https://www.theblock.co/post/324294/trump-harris-us-election-bitcoin-crypto) bitcoin could break all-time highs and reach $80,000 to $90,000 should Trump win in the run-up to inauguration day on Jan. 20, 2025. Meanwhile, JPMorgan analysts [ say ](https://www.theblock.co/post/323890/jpmorgan-bitcoin-upside-trump) a Trump win could drive more retail demand for bitcoin.\n\n“No matter who wins the presidency, expect U.S. debt ratings downgrades and a greater focus from treasury buyers on the sustainability of fiscal plans,” VanEck Head of Digital Assets Research Matthew Sigel  [told The Block ](https://www.theblock.co/post/319515/trump-harris-crypto-impact) last month. “We think bitcoin is a winner under those circumstances. How the rest of the market (altcoins) act will depend more on who wins, with Trump the ETH holder clearly better for proof-of-stake coins if current policies continue.”\n\n##**MAGA, Musk and memecoins**There has been no shortage of [ memecoins ](https://www.theblock.co/post/315902/donald-trump-themed-memecoins-sell-off-following-presidential-debate-with-vp-kamala-harris) looking to cash in on Trump’s popularity, though some have shown more staying power than others. It should be noted these tokens have no official affiliation with Trump.\n\nMAGA (ticker: TRUMP) launched in September 2023 and has amassed a market cap of $166 million at the time of writing. The token hit an all-time high above $17 in June and currently trades around $3.66. Among other notable memecoins are Doland Tremp (TREMP), with a $31 million market cap and MAGA Hat (MAGA), with an $80 million market cap.\n\nThe overall PolitiFi market cap is $691 million, according to CoinGecko. Political Finance (PolitiFi) are memecoins inspired by political figures.\n\nThe original memecoin, Dogecoin, has also benefited from Trump’s run. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has spent tens of millions of dollars to help reelect Trump and has frequently talked about creating a “Department of Government Efficiency,” or D.O.G.E, to cut back on wasteful spending and complicated regulations.\n\n“Having highly credible and influential people who understand the value of crypto from a freedom/decentralization perspective is a net good for the space, full stop,” Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan [ told The Block ](https://www.theblock.co/post/322699/how-elon-musks-recent-political-ambitions-with-donald-trump-could-impact-the-crypto-market). “I don\'t think you can short-term ‘trade\' his remarks, but I think you can own the trend.”\n\n##**Trump promotes World Liberty Financial**Trump’s most direct foray into the crypto world came from the [ DeFi project World Liberty Financial ](https://www.theblock.co/post/321638/crypto-pundits-decry-world-liberty-financials-lackluster-sales-calling-it-a-meme-masquerading-as-a-utility-project). Trump is listed as WLF’s "chief crypto advocate," and his three sons—Donald Jr., Eric and Barron—are its Web3 ambassadors.\n\nDespite two months of hype surrounding the project, World Liberty Financial’s public token sale generated just $10 million on its first day. At the time of writing, about 981 million WLFI tokens had been sold for $0.015 apiece, a fraction of the 20 billion tokens available to the public.\n\n"[I]n DeFi, utility matters," Bitwise’s Hougan told The Block. "WLF struck me as a meme masquerading as a utility project. I think people recognized that and so it didn\'t take. DeFi also can\'t be personality-focused. That\'s where the \'De\' comes from. And so, a personality-focused DeFi project is just a little oil and water."\n\n##**What’s next?**Kamala Harris has not come anywhere close to her competitor in trying to court the crypto industry, but some experts say that may not matter too much.\n\n"Of course, in the short term, crypto favors a Trump victory over a Harris victory, but really, Bitcoin doesn\'t need Washington to succeed," Hougan  [recently said ](https://www.theblock.co/post/323717/post-election-regulatory-environment-is-more-important-for-ethereum-altcoins-bitwise-cio). "Institutions are moving into the space, adoption is rising, ETF flows are happening. I think we go higher either way."\n\nAnalysis from VanEck’s Matthew Sigel and Nathan Frankovitz suggests that the election outcome could be mixed: " [T]he trend of growing fiscal deficits and rising national debt will likely continue. This suggests a weakening of the U.S. dollar, a macroeconomic environment in which Bitcoin has historically thrived."\n\nAccording to Alison Mangiero, executive director at the advocacy group Proof of Stake Alliance, people who identify as pro-crypto will fill Congress beyond the presidency.\n\n"Regardless of how each race shakes out, we are going to have the most pro-crypto Congress we\'ve ever had," Mangiero  [told The Block ](https://www.theblock.co/post/324397/upcoming-us-elections-poised-to-influence-crypto-legislation-in-2025-heres-what-could-happen-next). "There will still be a lot of work to do in terms of education and in terms of the industry because we\'ve poured so much money into these races that now the real work is going to begin."\n\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

    content:
      "Hype, a new memecoin trading platform on Solana and Base, has introduced a “President Memecoin Index” enabling traders to track and trade tokens related to the upcoming U.S. election.\n\nThe index tracks some of the largest memecoins associated, though not officially affiliated, with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. This includes Doland Tremp (TREMP), MAGA token (TRUMP) and Donald Trump (TRUMP) as well as Kamala Horris (KAMA), Krazy Kamala (KAMALA) and KAMALA HARRIS (HARRIS).\n\n“The challenge with memecoins around events or trends is that sometimes there isn’t ‘one’ coin everyone rallies around. With presidents, for example, there are multiple, and so an index visualization helps capture more surface area around the trend,” Hype founder Ravi Bakhai told The Block in an interview.\n\nThe index is designed to track these tokens' prices and provide insight into potential election outcomes, similar to how betting platforms harness market insight. Some see platforms like blockchain-based Polymarket as providing a less biased view into the likelihood of future events over polls because those with “skin in the game” are incentivized to wager on what they truly believe.\n\nPresidential memecoins are part of a micro-trend in crypto called “PoliFi,” a play on the portmanteau DeFi.\n\n“If you think one outcome is going to happen, you would buy that candidate's coin,” Bakhai said. “Memecions are essentially attention markets, so if more attention goes to one candidate, the higher the price will go.”\n\nRight now, mere hours before polls open on Tuesday, Hype’s index shows that the weighted basket of Trump-themed tokens is up 86.9% since the presidential debate in mid-September. Harris-themed tokens are up 48.9%.\n\n“Weirdly enough, the President Memecoin Index closely tracks what we’re seeing on prediction markets like Polymarket/Kalshi. Trump initially had a significant gap just as what we saw in the prediction markets and now Kamala is closing in,” Bakhai said.\n\nOn  [Polymarket ](https://polymarket.com/event/presidential-election-winner-2024?tid=1727776747670), Trump’s odds now stand at around 57%, down from a recent high above 66% at the end of October.\n\nBakhai noted one particular difference between PoliFi token forecasting and betting markets: memecoins have “uncapped upside,” in that a token’s price can rally long after the election is called.\n\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

    content:
      'Traders are betting on various squirrel-themed memecoins on the Solana-based platform Pump.fun following news that New York wildlife officials euthanized a pet named Peanut.\n\nThe squirrel, something of a minor internet fascination before being detained on Oct. 30 and put to death two days later, has become the latest cause célèbre among conservative commentators who describe the incident as a gross misuse of state power.\n\nPeanuts virality, and subsequent immortalization on the blockchain in the form of memecoins, speak to the strange political environment ahead of the U.S. presidential election on Tuesday. Some believe that memecoins act as a barometer for public interest.\n\nTwo of the largest squirrel tokens by market cap, Pnut and Nut In Profit, have over $37 million in bets riding on them — though dozens of tokens have been launched to capitalize on Peanut\'s legacy and politicization. Nut in Profit (ticker:  [NIP ](https://pump.fun/E3WqU3fpzS7PFnxj8bjzwezHTQfdnoCkd3ofYJDYpump)) was launched just six hours ago before publication time.\n\nPump.fun is a platform that enables anyone with access to launch a token. The platform uses a unique bonding curve mechanism that increases token prices as demand increases along a predefined curve, rewarding early buyers. Once a token’s market cap reaches $69,000, it is automatically migrated to the leading Solana decentralized exchange, Raydium.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance have both commented on Peanut, using the rodent’s death as a metaphor for the "misguided priorities" of the Democrat party.\n\nElon Musk, who has endorsed Trump, has also posted several times about Peanut’s untimely demise. Musk is known in crypto circles for his ability to drive attention towards memecoins, particularly Dogecoin.\n\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

      'The cryptocurrency industry has flooded the U.S. Congressional elections with cash, which could have a major effect on how legislation shakes out in 2025.\n\nFairshake, for example, has [raised ](https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/fairshake-pac/C00835959/summary/2024) over $200 million in this election cycle to put behind key races, according to Open Secrets, with funding coming from large crypto firms, including Ripple and Coinbase. Some of the biggest races to be on the lookout for on Tuesday include matchups for the Senate in Ohio and Montana.\n\nMore seats in Congress will be filled by people who identify as being pro-crypto, marking a first in this election, said Alison Mangiero, executive director at the Proof of Stake Alliance, an advocacy group for technology around staking.\n\n"Regardless of how each race shakes out, we are going to have the most pro-crypto Congress we\'ve ever had," Mangiero said in an interview with The Block. "There will still be a lot of work to do in terms of education and in terms of the industry because we\'ve poured so much money into these races that now the real work is going to begin."\n\nThe presidential candidates themselves have weighed in on the crypto industry, which has been unique to this election year. Vice President Kamala Harris  has said her [administration ](https://www.theblock.co/post/318216/kamala-harris-says-us-should-become-dominant-in-blockchain-reiterates-digital-assets-in-economic-plan) would encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets while protecting consumers and investors, according to her [80-page economic plan ](https://kamalaharris.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Policy_Book_Economic-Opportunity.pdf).\n\nFormer president Donald Trump has made his own pledge to end an "unlawful and un-American crackdown" on the U.S. crypto industry and has backed a crypto project called [World Liberty Financial ](https://www.theblock.co/post/320883/trump-backed-world-liberty-financial-claims-over-100000-whitelist-signups-adds-paxos-co-founder-rich-teo-ahead-of-public-token-sale).\n\nIn the meantime, prediction markets have also played a significant role in this year\'s election. Courts [ruled ](https://www.theblock.co/post/319206/federal-court-clears-kalshi-to-list-election-betting-contracts-denies-cftcs-motion) that prediction market Kalshi could go ahead and offer bets on the elections, and its markets went live. In the meantime, decentralized prediction platform Polymarket\'s betting volume for who will win the U.S. presidential race ballooned to almost $3 million as of Nov. 1. Polymarket, notably, does not operate in the U.S.\n\n[Analysts](https://www.theblock.co/post/323007/polymarket-manipulation-us-election-liquidity)  have said that prediction markets, like any market, aren\'t always accurate but are effective in aggregating real-time public sentiment. The Block cited Kalshi\'s figures to see how the election could unfold in Congress. For reference, current polls from 538 say Republicans have a 91% chance of taking the [Senate ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/senate/), while control of the House is much closer. Republicans have a 51% chance, while Democrats have a 49% chance, according to [538 ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2024-election-forecast/house/). All figures were gathered on Monday morning.\n\n## An 80% chance Republicans take the Senate, Democrats 20%\n\nOne of the more influential committees in the Senate is the Senate Banking Committee, which has jurisdiction over the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Both agencies oversee crypto. Right now, the committee is being led by Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, who has been viewed as critical of the crypto industry and is in a tight race in his state against crypto-friendly Republican candidate Bernie Moreno.\n\nIf the Senate were to flip Republican, top Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., could take the helm of the Senate Banking Committee no matter if Brown wins his race.\n\nScott, who is currently the top Republican on the Senate committee, has more recently shown support for the crypto industry. In August, he [proposed ](https://www.theblock.co/post/312544/republican-sen-tim-scott-floats-creating-digital-asset-focused-panel-if-he-chairs-senate-banking-committee) creating a subcommittee focused on the digital asset industry if he became chair. A spokesperson for Scott said the lawmaker plans to work on a framework to regulate digital assets should that happen.\n\n"Senator Scott will work to build a regulatory framework that establishes a reliable pathway for the trading and custody of digital assets that will promote consumer choice, education, and protection and ensure compliance with appropriate Bank Secrecy Act requirements," the spokesperson said in an emailed statement to The Block.\n\nIf Scott creates a digital asset-focused subcommittee, it could serve as a "precursor" for future crypto legislation, said Ron Hammond, director of government relations at the Blockchain Association. For example, the House Financial Services Committee has a subcommittee focused on digital assets that has been instrumental in jumpstarting crypto bills.\n\n"We could assume that with that subcommittee, this will be an area where not only the Senate either takes up the House bills, but they could even potentially start their own bills, whether it be stablecoins, market structure, or something different on the AML [anti-money laundering] front," Hammond said in an interview with The Block.\n\nIf Democrats hold onto the Senate, Brown would likely remain chair of the Senate Banking Committee. However, if he loses his race and Democrats still hold the majority, there is a chance that Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., could become chair. That scenario, though, is unlikely because Ohio is a swing state, so Democrats would have to pick up other states to get control of the Senate.\n\n"There has to be a lot of very unlikely circumstances for Warren to be chair," Hammond said.\n\nWarren has notoriously been critical of crypto, is pushing for the crypto industry to follow anti-money laundering rules, and is behind a bill  that would extend Bank Secrecy Act requirements, including know-your-customer rules, to miners, validators and wallet providers.\n\nPOSA\'s Mangiero says she expects more of a willingness from lawmakers in a Republican-led Senate to move forward bills that have already been introduced. Two prominent bills have gained traction in the House — one focused on crypto market structure dubbed FIT21 and another to regulate stablecoins.\n\nAs for stablecoins, both Democrats and Republicans have been yearning to get a bill done. On the Senate side, Sen. Bill Hagerty, R-Tenn., [introduced ](https://www.theblock.co/post/320627/sen-hagertys-stablecoin-regulation-draft-aims-for-clarity-echoes-house-bill-framework) draft legislation in October for a bill that closely resembles work being done in the House.\n\n"If we have a Republican-led Senate, the chances are just better that that gets done," Mangiero said in an interview with The Block. "But stablecoins are one of these issues where I really think Democrats are willing to play ball."\n\nAs for chances for a market structure-type bill to regulate crypto in a Democrat-led Senate, Mangiero said, "Anything is possible."\n\n## A 53% chance Democrats take the House, Republicans close behind\n\nThe House Financial Services Committee has been at the crux of crypto-related bills being introduced, and some passed over the past few years under its chair, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C. McHenry is set to [retire ](https://www.theblock.co/post/266168/crypto-friendly-rep-patrick-mchenry-wont-be-seeking-re-election) in January 2025, leaving a space open for a new lead.\n\nMcHenry was pivotal in leading efforts for both a stablecoin bill and FIT21. McHenry said in September that he thinks  his bill could gain [momentum ](https://www.theblock.co/post/316881/us-lawmakers-spark-optimism-on-crypto-bills-gaining-traction-after-election-season-is-over) during the lame-duck session, the time period after the election and before a new Congress steps in in January.\n\nWhichever party wins the White House will likely win the House as well, Hammond said. A House Financial Services Committee chair will also likely be picked by November or December, he added. Names being thrown to lead the committee if Republicans have control include Reps. French Hill of Arkansas, Andy Barr of Kentucky, Bill Huizenga of Michigan and Frank Lucas of Oklahoma — all friendly toward crypto.\n\n"Regardless of who\'s chair on the Republican side, it\'s going to be focused on stablecoins, if it doesn\'t get done by the end of this year, and market structure, and then, likely DeFi, NFTs toward the 2026 timeframe of their tenure," Hammond said.\n\nIf Democrats take the House, Rep. Maxine Waters of California could once again lead the House Financial Services Committee. Waters, who has sometimes been critical of crypto, has also been very open to getting a stablecoin bill across the finish line. During a congressional hearing in September, Waters called for a "grand bargain on stablecoins" before the end of the year.\n\n"I\'ve made a public statement to you about bipartisanship — let\'s see what you do with it," Waters told McHenry during that hearing.\n\n"So if that doesn\'t get done this year, it is very likely she will pick up where she left off," Hammond said. Waters did not respond to a request for comment from The Block asking about what her priorities for crypto would be if she chairs the committee.\n\nHowever, Waters was against FIT21, so the pathway for that specific bill is unclear, Hammond said, but he added that it is up to whether Waters believes a regulatory framework is needed for digital assets.\n\nThe White House has said it [opposed ](https://www.theblock.co/post/296047/white-house-opposes-fit21-but-says-its-eager-to-work-with-congress-on-balanced-framework-for-digital-assets) FIT21 but said it was " eager to work with Congress to ensure a comprehensive and balanced regulatory framework for digital assets" in a statement released in May. Meanwhile, SEC Chair Gary Gensler has said that new rules are unnecessary for crypto and has called on crypto entities to register and follow its rules.\n\nTaxes will also come up in 2025 as lawmakers face a deadline when Trump\'s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act expires at the end of next year, Hammond said.\n\n"When there is a big tax bill on Capitol Hill, it\'s an open season for tax as a whole," Hammond said, adding that crypto tax proposals will come up in discussions. For example, part of that discussion could include a [bill ](https://www.theblock.co/post/291976/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-clarify-taxation-of-staking-rewards) introduced by  Reps. Wiley Nickel, D-N.C. and Drew Ferguson, R-Ga., would clarify that staking rewards should only be taxed at the time of sale.\n\n## Specific elections to be on the lookout for\n\nHammond said the Senate race in Ohio will likely be the most significant. Another contentious race could be the Senate race in Montana. There, Democrat Sen. Jon Tester is facing off against Republican Tim Sheehy. [Stand With Crypto ](https://www.standwithcrypto.org/races/state/mt/senate) gave Sheey an A for his friendliness toward crypto, while Tester received a C.\n\nNotably, Tester was one of a handful of Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y.,  to overturn an SEC bulletin [establishing ](https://www.theblock.co/post/294949/us-senate-passes-measure-withdrawing-sec-accounting-bulletin)  certain accounting standards for firms that custody crypto.\n\nOverall, Hammond said that after talking with candidates nationwide, many appear friendly toward crypto.\n\n"The good thing is that there\'s a lot of races that have pro-crypto Democrats, pro-crypto Republicans," Hammond added. For example, in Arizona\'s Senate race, Republican candidate Kari Lake and Democrat Ruben Gallego both received an A grade from Stand With Crypto. Fairshake has given millions to Gallego for his race, according to news reports.\n\nPOSA\'s Mangiero elaborated on next year being the "most pro-crypto Congress ever." That will include people who identify as pro-crypto, she said, but also means future lawmakers could be more open-minded.\n\n"I also think you\'re going to have people who are at least a little bit more open-minded because they are going to have to be educated on these topics in order to govern effectively," she said.\n\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

As the two have battled it out for market dominance, overall trading volumes have collapsed. OpenSea has recently managed to claw back some of its market share, but overall trading volumes are at their lowest in more than three years, according to [The Block Data Dashboard](https://www.theblock.co/data/nft-non-fungible-tokens/marketplaces).\n\nOne trend that Blur\'s overtaking of OpenSea appears to have demonstrated is that NFT traders [became increasingly interested](https://www.theblock.co/post/305374/the-battle-for-nft-marketplace-dominance-is-heating-up-again) in using platforms that offered more than just basic buying and selling functionality. [Blur\'s success](https://www.theblock.co/post/261756/blurs-soaring-token-jumps-even-more-after-rival-opensea-cuts-50-of-staff) also suggested traders wanted more sophisticated trading tools while it wooed new users with token rewards.\n\nOpenSea\'s makeover comes at a time when it appears there is little hope for NFTs coming down the pike. In January of this year, NFT monthly trading volumes for Ethereum-based non-fungible tokens hit $868 million before sliding to $300 million in June and then $136 million last month, according to [The Block Data Dashboard](https://www.theblock.co/data/nft-non-fungible-tokens/marketplaces/nft-marketplace-monthly-volume).\n\nDisclaimer: The Block is an independent media outlet that delivers news, research, and data.

    content:
      'Vlayer, a crypto startup developing "Solidity 2.0" — which adds new functions to Ethereum\'s smart contract language — has raised $10 million in a pre-seed funding round.\n\nInvestors in the round include a16z Crypto Startup Accelerator (CSX), Credo Ventures and BlockTower Capital, Vlayer said Monday. Angel investors such as Remco Bloemen from World (formerly Worldcoin), Jakub Florkiewicz from World developer Tools For Humanity, and Zac Williamson, Joe Andrews and Kev Wedderburn from Aztec also participated.\n\nA $10 million pre-seed round is substantial. It was completed in two tranches: $3 million was closed in February within a week, while $7 million was closed in August in less than a month, Hubert Rachwalski von Rejchwald, co-founder and CEO of Vlayer, told The Block. The second tranche was structured as a top-up "with modified terms," Rejchwald said, but he declined to comment on the valuation. He said the round was structured as a combination of a simple agreement for future equity (SAFE) and a simple agreement for future tokens (SAFT).\n\n## What is Vlayer?\n\nVlayer is a crypto startup developing "verifiable data infrastructure," calling it "Solidity 2.0." It aims to enable developers to verify and integrate real-world data into Ethereum smart contracts.\n\nSpecifically, Vlayer will introduce four new functions to [Ethereum](https://www.theblock.co/learn/249527/what-is-ethereum-and-how-does-it-work-a-beginners-guide-to-eth-cryptocurrency)\'s Solidity language: Time Travel (execute smart contracts using historical on-chain data), Teleport (run contracts across multiple EVM-compatible networks), Web proofs/ zkTLS (verify and integrate web content, including APIs and websites) and Email proofs/ ZK Email (access and verify email content).\n\n"We offer access to additional verifiable data sources directly from Solidity code," Rejchwald said. "This means that ZK [zero knowledge proofs] will be finally productized as something that is familiar and easy to use for any Solidity smart contract developer."\n\nRejchwald said that Vlayer takes a holistic approach to key verifiable data sources, integrating web proofs, email proofs and storage proofs, while other projects typically focus on only one of these areas. "For web proofs you should know zkPass or Reclaim Protocol, for email proofs you could use directly ZK Email, while storage proofs have Axiom, Lagrange or Brevis," he said.\n\nLast month, [zkPass raised](https://www.theblock.co/post/321723/zkpass-funding-token-valuation) $12.5 million in a Series A funding round at a $100 million token valuation.\n\nRejchwald claimed that once developers experience the enhanced Solidity functions being introduced, they will never want to revert to the previous version. As AI and decentralized applications continue to expand, the need for verifiable, trustless data is only going to increase, according to Rejchwald.\n\n## Vlayer testnet, mainnet and token launch schedule\n\nVlayer is currently in an "open alpha" phase, inviting developers to build on its platform. "We are currently onboarding the first dozen of dapp developers spread across DeFi, RWA [real world assets] and gaming subsegments. There will be more sectors covered," Rejchwald said.\n\nHe said the Vlayer testnet, mainnet, and token launch are expected "no sooner than 2025. "\n\nVlayer currently employs 20 people, and Rejchwald plans to expand the team by hiring additional staff across various functions.\n\n---**The Funding newsletter:**Stay updated on the latest crypto funding news and trends with my bimonthly newsletter, The Funding.
